# Golf Ball Simulation 

The ultimate goal of this simulation is to use Monte Carlo simulations to predict the landing radius of a golf ball. This simulation takes into consideration a non-ideal scenario, 
where drag forces and lift forces (Magnus Effect) are taken into consideration. 

## Equations of Motion

Consider a golf ball of mass $m$
